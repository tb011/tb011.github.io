**Aim**

Given series of data tables could I extract valuable information on patients an SQL database?

Let's give it a go!

**Data **

***Data Tables ***

***Appendix A***

Gender: 1 = Male, 2 = Female, 9 = Unknown

Ethnicity: 01 = White, 02 = Non-white, 03 = Unknown

***Appendix B***

Prostate = C61, Breast = C50, Lung = C34, Colorectal = C18, C19, C20
